## Bucketlist 
A bucketlist is a list of stuff you ought to do before you go ghost aka kick the bucket. It is a list of goals that need to be achieved before a certain age.

This bucket list application was built on top Reactjs to consume a public REST api that can be found at [bucketapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1](bucketapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1).
